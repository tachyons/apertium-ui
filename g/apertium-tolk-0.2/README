==Requirements==

You need:

* D-Bus for Python (http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus) 
 - almost every modern UNIX will have a package for this. You can install 
   this in Debian/Ubuntu Linux by issuing:
 
   $ sudo apt-get install python-dbus

* Apertium-dbus 

   $ sudo apt-get install apertium-dbus

Restart the daemons:

$ dbus-send / org.apertium.General.QuitSignal

==Notes==

After installing a new language pair you will need to restart the 
D-Bus service.

  $ sudo /etc/init.d/dbus restart

in order for the pair to become available. If you do not do that, you
will probably see errors like:

  org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.UnknownMethod: Method "translate" with signature "a{ss}s" on interface "org.apertium.Mode" doesn't exist

or

  ERROR:dbus.connection:Unable to set arguments ({}, 'A') according to signature None: exceptions.ValueError: Unable to guess signature from an empty dict
  Unable to guess signature from an empty dict
